This project uses OpenCV, TensorFlow, and image processing libraries to detect faces in images or videos. The code is written in Python and implemented in a Jupyter Notebook.

ðŸ“¦ Installation
System Requirements
Python 3.7+

Install Dependencies
Use pip to install the required libraries:


pip install opencv-python numpy tensorflow matplotlib
ðŸš€ How to Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/username/detect-face.git
cd detect-face

Launch Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook detect_face.ipynb
Execute each code cell in the notebook to:

Load face detection models (Haar Cascade or TensorFlow).

Process input images/videos.

Display results with bounding boxes around detected faces.
